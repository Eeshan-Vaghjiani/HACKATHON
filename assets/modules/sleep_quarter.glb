# Placeholder GLB file for Sleep Quarter module
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLTF file
# containing the 3D model, textures, and materials for the sleep quarter module.
#
# The sleep quarter module should include:
# - Individual crew sleeping area (2.0 x 2.0 x 2.5 meters)
# - Privacy partition or curtain
# - Personal storage compartments
# - Ventilation and lighting systems
# - Connection ports for habitat integration
#
# This placeholder file should be replaced with actual 3D assets
# created in Blender, Maya, or other 3D modeling software and
# exported in GLB format with proper scaling (1 unit = 1 meter).
