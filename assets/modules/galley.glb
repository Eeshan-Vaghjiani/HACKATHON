# Placeholder GLB file for Galley module
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLTF file
# containing the 3D model for the galley/kitchen module.
#
# The galley module should include:
# - Food preparation surfaces and equipment
# - Water dispensing and recycling systems
# - Waste management interfaces
# - Dining area with restraints for microgravity
# - Storage for food and utensils
# - Connection ports for utilities
#
# Dimensions: 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.2 meters
# This placeholder should be replaced with actual 3D assets.
