# Placeholder GLB file for Mechanical/ECLSS module
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLTF file
# containing the 3D model for the Environmental Control & Life Support Systems.
#
# The mechanical module should include:
# - Atmosphere processing equipment (CO2 scrubbers, O2 generators)
# - Thermal control systems (radiators, heat exchangers)
# - Power distribution and battery systems
# - Water recycling and purification systems
# - Maintenance access panels and tools
# - Redundant system components
#
# Dimensions: 3.5 x 2.8 x 2.5 meters
# This placeholder should be replaced with actual 3D assets.
