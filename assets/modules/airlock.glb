# Placeholder GLB file for Airlock module
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLTF file
# containing the 3D model for the EVA airlock.
#
# The airlock module should include:
# - Pressurized chamber with dual hatches
# - EVA suit storage and donning area
# - Life support interface connections
# - Emergency backup systems
# - Tool and equipment storage
# - Pressure monitoring and control systems
#
# Dimensions: 2.5 x 2.5 x 3.0 meters
# This placeholder should be replaced with actual 3D assets.
