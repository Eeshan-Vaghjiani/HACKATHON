# Placeholder GLB file for Laboratory module
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLTF file
# containing the 3D model for the multi-purpose laboratory.
#
# The laboratory module should include:
# - Research workbenches and equipment racks
# - Microscopy and analysis stations
# - Sample storage with temperature control
# - Data connectivity and power distribution
# - Contamination control systems
# - Vibration isolation mounts
#
# Dimensions: 4.0 x 3.0 x 2.8 meters
# This placeholder should be replaced with actual 3D assets.
