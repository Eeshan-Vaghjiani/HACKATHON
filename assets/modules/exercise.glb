# Placeholder GLB file for Exercise module
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLTF file
# containing the 3D model for the exercise and fitness area.
#
# The exercise module should include:
# - Cardiovascular exercise equipment (treadmill, bike)
# - Resistance training systems
# - Safety restraints and harnesses
# - Vibration isolation systems
# - Air circulation and cooling systems
# - Equipment storage and maintenance area
#
# Dimensions: 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.8 meters
# This placeholder should be replaced with actual 3D assets.
