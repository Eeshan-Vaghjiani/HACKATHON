# Placeholder GLB file for Storage module
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLTF file
# containing the 3D model for the general storage module.
#
# The storage module should include:
# - Configurable storage racks and compartments
# - Environmental controls (temperature, humidity)
# - Inventory tracking systems
# - Access control mechanisms
# - Modular storage containers
# - Efficient space utilization design
#
# Dimensions: 2.5 x 2.0 x 2.0 meters
# This placeholder should be replaced with actual 3D assets.
