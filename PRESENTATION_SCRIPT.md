## Opening (Jordan - 30 seconds)

**Jordan:** "Good morning everyone! I'm Jordan, and this is Alex. We're excited to present HabitatCanvas - an AI-powered space habitat design and optimization platform that's revolutionizing how we approach space architecture.

Imagine you're designing a habitat for Mars. You need to optimize for crew safety, resource efficiency, and psychological well-being - all while working within strict mass and power constraints. That's exactly what HabitatCanvas solves."

---

## Problem Statement (Jordan - 45 seconds)

**Jordan:** "Current space habitat design is a manual, time-intensive process that relies heavily on expert intuition. Engineers spend months creating layouts, only to discover critical issues late in the design cycle.

The challenges are immense:

- **Safety**: Emergency egress paths must be optimized
- **Efficiency**: Every cubic meter and kilogram matters
- **Human Factors**: Crew psychology and workflow optimization
- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Balancing competing requirements

Traditional CAD tools weren't built for this complexity. We needed something smarter."

## Live Demo - Planetary Computer Integration (Alex - 2 minutes)

**Alex:** "Let me show you our newest feature - Microsoft Planetary Computer integration."

_[Clicks Planetary Computer tab]_

"This is where we leverage Microsoft's petabytes of Earth observation data:

**Site Analysis:**
_[Enters coordinates for a Mars analog site]_

- **Real-time Analysis**: Using NASADEM elevation data and Landsat imagery
- **Terrain Characteristics**: Slope, roughness, accessibility scores
- **Environmental Data**: Temperature ranges, precipitation, solar irradiance
- **Suitability Scoring**: AI-powered assessment for habitat placement

_[Clicks Analyze Site]_

Watch as we get real environmental data from Microsoft's platform. This isn't simulated - we're pulling actual satellite data, climate models, and terrain analysis.

**Optimal Site Finding:**
_[Switches to Find Optimal Sites tab]_

- **Regional Analysis**: Define search boundaries
- **Multi-criteria Optimization**: Combines terrain, climate, and accessibility
- **Ranked Results**: Top candidates with detailed analysis

This transforms habitat design from theoretical to data-driven reality."

## Live Demo - Volume Builder (Alex - 1.5 minutes)

**Alex:** "Let me walk you through the application. First, we start with the Volume Builder."

_[Opens http://localhost:3000]_

"Here's our parametric volume creation system. Watch as I design a cylindrical habitat:

_[Clicks Volume Builder tab]_

- **Parametric Design**: I can adjust radius, height, and wall thickness in real-time
- **3D Preview**: The Three.js engine renders changes instantly
- **Constraint Validation**: The system warns me if dimensions violate safety requirements
- **Freeform Sculpting**: For complex shapes, we support spline-based modifications

_[Adjusts parameters, shows real-time updates]_

The beauty here is that everything is validated in real-time. If I make the radius too small, the system immediately flags potential issues."

---

## Mission Parameters (Jordan - 1 minute)

**Jordan:** "Next, we configure mission parameters - this is where human factors meet engineering constraints."

_[Clicks Mission Parameters tab]_

"For our Mars habitat demo:

- **Crew Size**: 4 astronauts for 500 days
- **Priority Weights**: We can emphasize safety over efficiency, or vice versa
- **Activity Schedules**: The system understands crew workflows
- **Emergency Scenarios**: Critical for safety validation

_[Adjusts parameters]_

Notice how the interface guides us through NASA's established requirements while allowing customization for specific missions. This isn't just theoretical - we've integrated real space agency standards."

---

## AI-Powered Layout Generation (Alex - 2 minutes)

**Alex:** "Now for the magic - our AI optimization engine."

_[Clicks Layout Generation tab]_

"This is where our NSGA-II genetic algorithm shines. Watch as it generates multiple optimized layouts:

_[Clicks Generate Layouts]_

**The Algorithm Process:**

1. **Population Initialization**: Creates random layout candidates
2. **Multi-Objective Evaluation**: Scores each layout on:

   - Mean transit time between modules
   - Emergency egress efficiency
   - Mass and power optimization
   - Thermal management
   - Life support system margins

3. **Pareto Front Evolution**: Finds optimal trade-offs between competing objectives
4. **Constraint Validation**: Ensures all safety and engineering requirements

_[Shows generated layouts]_

Look at these results! Each layout represents a different optimization strategy. Layout A prioritizes safety with shorter egress paths. Layout B maximizes space efficiency. Layout C balances both.

The system generated these in seconds - what would take human designers weeks."

---

## 3D Visualization & Interactive Editing (Alex - 1.5 minutes)

**Alex:** "But we're not just generating layouts - we're making them interactive."

_[Selects a layout, shows 3D view]_

"Our Three.js visualization engine provides:

- **Interactive Module Editing**: Drag-and-drop repositioning
- **Collision Detection**: Prevents invalid placements
- **Constraint Visualization**: Visual feedback for violations

_[Demonstrates dragging a module]_

Watch as I move this sleep module - the system immediately:

- Validates connectivity requirements
- Updates performance metrics in real-time
- Highlights constraint violations

The snap-to-grid system ensures precision while maintaining design flexibility."
