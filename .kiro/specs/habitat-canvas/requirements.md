# Requirements Document

## Introduction

HabitatCanvas is a web-based generative layout studio for space habitats that enables users to define pressurized habitat volumes and automatically generate, evaluate, and iterate interior layouts that satisfy engineering and human factors constraints. The system combines 3D visualization, multi-objective optimization, and real-time systems simulation to reduce early-stage layout-to-systems iteration time from weeks to minutes.

The primary goal is to surface hidden tradeoffs in habitat design (e.g., layouts that save crew transit time may increase thermal loads) while providing explainable AI-generated recommendations backed by quantitative metrics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a habitat designer, I want to create and modify pressurized habitat volumes using parametric primitives and freeform sculpting, so that I can define the physical constraints for layout generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a parametric primitive (cylinder, torus, box) THEN the system SHALL provide dimension controls for that shape
2. WHEN a user modifies dimension parameters THEN the system SHALL update the 3D visualization in real-time
3. WHEN a user enables freeform sculpting mode THEN the system SHALL allow spline-based volume modification
4. WHEN a user completes volume definition THEN the system SHALL export the envelope specification in JSON format
5. IF a user imports a volume file THEN the system SHALL load and display the habitat envelope with editable parameters

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mission planner, I want to specify mission parameters and crew requirements, so that the layout generator can optimize for mission-specific constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses mission parameters THEN the system SHALL provide inputs for crew size, mission duration, and priority weights
2. WHEN a user adjusts priority sliders (safety vs efficiency vs mass) THEN the system SHALL update optimization objectives accordingly
3. WHEN a user selects a mission template THEN the system SHALL pre-populate parameters with appropriate defaults
4. IF crew size exceeds habitat capacity limits THEN the system SHALL display a warning message
5. WHEN parameters are set THEN the system SHALL validate constraints before allowing layout generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a habitat designer, I want the system to automatically generate multiple candidate layouts from my habitat volume and mission parameters, so that I can explore design alternatives quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Generate Layouts" THEN the system SHALL produce 3-8 candidate layouts within 30 seconds
2. WHEN generating layouts THEN the system SHALL ensure no module overlaps and maintain walkway clearances
3. WHEN generating layouts THEN the system SHALL enforce pressurized connectivity between all modules
4. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL display layout thumbnails with quick metrics
5. IF generation fails due to constraints THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a systems engineer, I want to see quantitative performance metrics for each generated layout, so that I can evaluate designs against engineering requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a layout is generated THEN the system SHALL compute mean transit time between functional modules
2. WHEN a layout is generated THEN the system SHALL calculate emergency egress times to airlocks
3. WHEN a layout is generated THEN the system SHALL estimate LSS margins (oxygen, CO2 scrubbing, water)
4. WHEN a layout is generated THEN the system SHALL compute power and thermal budgets
5. WHEN a layout is generated THEN the system SHALL calculate stowage utilization metrics
6. IF any metric exceeds safety thresholds THEN the system SHALL highlight the issue with warning indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a habitat designer, I want to visualize and inspect layouts in 3D with detailed metrics, so that I can understand the spatial relationships and performance characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a layout thumbnail THEN the system SHALL display a detailed 3D view
2. WHEN in 3D view THEN the system SHALL provide camera controls for orbit, pan, and zoom
3. WHEN inspecting a layout THEN the system SHALL display a metrics panel with all computed KPIs
4. WHEN hovering over modules THEN the system SHALL show module-specific information and connections
5. WHEN toggling heatmap mode THEN the system SHALL overlay crew movement patterns and congestion areas

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a habitat designer, I want to manually edit generated layouts and see immediate feedback on performance changes, so that I can fine-tune designs based on my expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags a module THEN the system SHALL update its position in real-time
2. WHEN a module is moved THEN the system SHALL immediately recompute affected metrics
3. WHEN editing violates constraints THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and show visual feedback
4. WHEN a user rotates a module THEN the system SHALL update connectivity and clearance checks
5. IF edits improve or worsen key metrics THEN the system SHALL highlight the changes with delta indicators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want to compare multiple layouts side-by-side and understand the tradeoffs, so that I can make informed design choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects multiple layouts THEN the system SHALL display them in comparison mode
2. WHEN comparing layouts THEN the system SHALL show metrics in a side-by-side table format
3. WHEN viewing comparisons THEN the system SHALL highlight the best and worst performing metrics
4. WHEN layouts are compared THEN the system SHALL display a Pareto front visualization for multi-objective tradeoffs
5. IF two layouts have similar performance THEN the system SHALL indicate which metrics differentiate them

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a habitat designer, I want to understand why the system made specific layout decisions, so that I can trust and learn from the AI recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a layout is generated THEN the system SHALL provide a natural-language explanation for key design decisions
2. WHEN displaying explanations THEN the system SHALL reference specific metrics and constraint impacts
3. WHEN a user modifies a layout THEN the system SHALL explain how changes affect performance
4. WHEN showing explanations THEN the system SHALL cite relevant requirements and design rules
5. IF a layout violates best practices THEN the system SHALL explain the tradeoffs and risks

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a systems engineer, I want to simulate crew workflows and emergency scenarios, so that I can validate layout performance under realistic operational conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs agent simulation THEN the system SHALL model crew daily activities and movement patterns
2. WHEN simulation runs THEN the system SHALL track module occupancy and corridor congestion over time
3. WHEN simulating emergencies THEN the system SHALL compute evacuation times and identify bottlenecks
4. WHEN simulation completes THEN the system SHALL generate heatmaps showing high-traffic areas
5. IF simulation reveals performance issues THEN the system SHALL suggest specific layout improvements

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want to export layouts and analysis results in standard formats, so that I can integrate with other design tools and share with team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user exports a layout THEN the system SHALL provide GLTF/GLB format for 3D models
2. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include JSON specifications with all module positions and parameters
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create PDF summaries with metrics and visualizations
4. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include PNG snapshots of key views and charts
5. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
