## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of task 9.1 "Build crew workflow simulation engine" from the HabitatCanvas project specifications.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Simulation Engine (`app/services/crew_simulation.py`)

**CrewAgent Class:**
- Individual crew member agents with roles (Commander, Pilot, Engineer, Scientist, Medic)
- Activity scheduling and pathfinding between modules
- Physiological state tracking (stress and fatigue levels)
- Movement history and distance tracking

**CrewWorkflowModel Class:**
- Mesa-based agent-based model for habitat simulation
- Connectivity graph generation from layout specifications
- Module capacity calculation based on type and crew size
- Real-time occupancy tracking and congestion detection
- Emergency evacuation scenario simulation

**AgentSimulator Class:**
- Main interface for running simulations
- Crew workflow simulation with configurable duration
- Emergency evacuation analysis
- Heatmap generation for traffic patterns
- Congestion pattern analysis with recommendations

### 2. Key Features Implemented

**Agent Behavior:**
- Realistic daily schedules (sleep, work, meals, exercise, recreation)
- Pathfinding using NetworkX shortest path algorithms
- Congestion avoidance and queuing behavior
- Role-based activity preferences

**Simulation Capabilities:**
- 24-hour crew workflow simulation with 15-minute time steps
- Emergency evacuation timing analysis
- Module occupancy tracking over time
- Movement event logging and analysis
- Stress and fatigue modeling

**Analysis & Metrics:**
- Traffic heatmaps showing module usage intensity
- Congestion hotspot identification
- Peak occupancy time analysis
- Crew utilization calculations
- Emergency egress time computation

### 3. API Endpoints (`app/api/api_v1/endpoints/simulation.py`)

**Implemented Endpoints:**
- `POST /simulation/crew-workflow/{layout_id}` - Run crew workflow simulation
- `POST /simulation/emergency-evacuation/{layout_id}` - Simulate emergency scenarios
- `GET /simulation/heatmap/{layout_id}` - Generate traffic heatmaps
- `POST /simulation/congestion-analysis/{layout_id}` - Analyze congestion patterns

**Response Features:**
- Comprehensive simulation results with movement events
- Safety assessments with evacuation time ratings
- Actionable recommendations for layout improvements
- Module occupancy summaries and utilization metrics

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/test_crew_simulation.py`)

**Test Coverage:**
- 20 comprehensive unit tests covering all major functionality
- Agent initialization and behavior testing
- Model connectivity and capacity validation
- Simulation workflow integration tests
- Edge case handling (disconnected modules, no airlocks)

**Test Categories:**
- CrewAgent class functionality
- CrewWorkflowModel simulation mechanics
- AgentSimulator interface methods
- Activity scheduling and management
- Full simulation workflow integration
